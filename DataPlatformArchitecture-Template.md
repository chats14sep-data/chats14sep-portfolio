# Introduction

## Purpose of Document
<The purpose of the Solution Architecture document is to provide a comprehensive overview and blueprint for designing and implementing a technical solution to resolve business challenges.>

## Business Objective
<Provide Business Objective>

# Solution Architecture

## Overview
<It is critical to design a secure, scalable, reliable, available, performant, cost-effective, and agile architecture framework for a data analytics platform. Solution architecture defines key components, features, processes, and methodology to achieve the required outcome.>

## Architecture Principles
<Elaborate key architecture principles, e.g., secure, agile, scalable, etc.>

## Conceptual Architecture
<Conceptual architecture lays out the business context components of the solution to help business users understand the architecture and solution overview.>

## Logical Architecture
<Logical architecture consists of the components/services used in the solution, along with data movement information and key solution features. It describes different layers of data orchestration, transformation, storage, modeling, and reporting. It also covers key non-functional components delivered as part of solution architecture implementation.>

### Key Solution Features
<Key Solution Features>

### Key Design Principles
- <Elaborate any IP leveraged>
- <Describe key benefits of leveraged IP>

## Platform and Environment Architecture
<Elaborate on how resources will be organized across subscriptions, resources, or workspaces.>

## Infrastructure and Network Design
<Provide key information about the data platform infrastructure and network design.>

---

# Solution Design

## Overview
Solution design expands the architecture components and elaborates on the functionality of each component. It provides details around the type of data load, frequency, storage details, data structure and organization, metadata framework, and transformation across each layer of the architecture.

## Design Components
<Explain each design component related to orchestration, transformation, and reporting.>

## Process Flow
<Elaborate on the processes involved in the data transformation journey, e.g., orchestration, transformation steps, modeling, and reporting.>

## Data Flow
<Show a graphical representation of data lineage across all layers of the ingestion and transformation process.>

### Data Sources
<Elaborate on each data source, connectors, frequency, and type of load.>

### Data Orchestration
<Elaborate on the data orchestration process, including source connectivity paradigms and any metadata frameworks.>

### Data Transformation
<Elaborate on the transformation process and methodology.>

### Semantic Layer & Reporting
- <Elaborate on the need for a semantic model, load method, approach, etc.>
- <Provide details on the data model (e.g., star, snowflake).>
- <Describe reporting key details.>

# Non-Functional Requirements

## Overview
Non-functional requirements are guardrails and capabilities applied to the solution to adhere to enterprise-scale data platform principles. Key non-functional requirements include:
- Data Lifecycle Management
- Security
- High Availability and Disaster Recovery
- Data Governance (Cataloging, Discovery, Lineage, Quality, Auditing, Compliance)
- Logging, Alerting, and Monitoring
- Data Sovereignty
- Use and Accessibility
- Performance
- Code Management and Release Process

### Data Lifecycle
| Storage Layer | Hot Tier (Regularly accessed) | Cold Tier      | Archival           | Purging          |
|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Raw           | <e.g. Last 3 Months>         | <3-12 Months>  | <12 Months & older>| <Retention Period>|

### Object Maintenance
<Elaborate on the object maintenance process for better performance.>

### Security
Security is paramount for any data platform solution. Data is the new currency of any organization and itâ€™s important to keep data secured within the enterprise network boundaries with well-defined authentication and authorization protocols along with role-based access controls.

### Networking
<Provide details on network guardrails.>

### Authentication and Authorization
<Provide connection and end-user authentication methodology. Leverage service accounts for source connectivity and AD groups for user connectivity.>

| AD Group      | Environment  | Azure RBAC Role |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
|               |              |                 |

### Encryption
<Provide details on data encryption at rest and in transit.>

### High Availability and Disaster Recovery
<Provide details on RPO, RTO, and SLA.>

| Resource Type | RTO   | RPO   | SLA   |
|---------------|-------|-------|-------|
|               |       |       |       |

### Data Governance
<Elaborate on capabilities such as data discovery, cataloging, quality, lineage, sharing, auditing, and compliance.>

### Logging, Monitoring, Error Handling, and Alerting
- **Logging**: <Elaborate on inbuilt and custom logging.>
- **Monitoring**: <How to monitor solution execution and performance.>
- **Error Handling**: <How errors are managed during ingestion and transformation.>
- **Alerting**: <Describe user alerts for process success or failure.>

### Use and Accessibility
<Data analytics solutions will be accessed by different personas based on their roles, and access will be configured accordingly.>

| Role          | Access                | License        |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Data Engineer | Azure Portal, Workspace | Power BI Pro   |

### Performance
Performance of a data analytics solution is categorized into:
- Process Performance (Ingestion and Transformation)
- Access Performance (End User Reporting)

### Code Management and Release Process
<Elaborate on code management, release processes, and guardrails.>
