| **Features**              | Databricks is a unified data analytics and AI platform that helps ingest, integrate, transform, and manage enterprise data at scale for business insights. It's a PAAS offering providing compute capabilities on cloud provider infrastructure and storage. Some unique features include Delta Live tables and Autoloader. | Fabric is a unified data analytics and AI platform that helps ingest, integrate, transform, and manage enterprise data at scale for business insights. It’s a SAAS offering from Microsoft with key features like One Lake, Common Storage Format as Delta lake, DataFlow Gen2, Visual query editor, and Direct Lake. Databricks has 90-95% of the features of Fabric, but Databricks has more features around transformation. The only distinguishing factor in Fabric is a matured Reporting Platform (Power BI). | Databricks: 90-95% of the features match, but Databricks has more features around transformation. The distinguishing factor in Fabric is a matured Reporting Platform (Power BI). | Bifurcate on Data Engineering, Science, and reporting |
| **Cloud Provider**        | Cloud Agnostic, available on GCP, Azure, and AWS.                                                                                                      | It’s a Microsoft Offering.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Databricks, because of offering across Cloud Providers, so even if the company's preferred Cloud Provider changes in the future, they don't need to redo their Analytics Platform. |                                                    |
| **Cost**                  | Since Databricks is a Compute Engine on top Cloud Provider Infrastructure and storage, the cluster cost and storage cost are according to the cloud provider. On top of this, Databricks charges Databricks Unit cost based on the cluster size. | Fabric costing is based on Capacity Units, which is a combination of CPU, IO, and RAM. Databricks is cheaper for the same workload based on time of execution and hardware configuration.                                               | Databricks: For the same workload based on time of execution and hardware configuration, Databricks is cheaper than Fabric.                                                 |                                                    |
| **Performance**           | Databricks has a Databricks Runtime engine sitting on top of the Spark engine, which boosts up the performance of the workload. Additionally, with the introduction of Photon (with additional cost), performance can be enhanced. | Faster performance in Fabric can be achieved by using higher Capacity units. The key differentiator in performance in Fabric is achieved through the use of Direct Lake, which boosts up the report execution performance compared to Direct Query in the older versions of Power BI. | Databricks: For a considerate level of workload, you will get similar performance in Databricks and Fabric, but you will start seeing performance differences as your datasize goes beyond GBs to TBs.                     |                                                    |
| **Ease of Use**           | It’s a core code-based platform where you need to write business transformation rules using Python, Scala, or SQL.                                    | It provides code as well as UI-based offerings for business rules transformation using Data Flow Gen2 and SQL visual editor. Fabric is the key USP with features that embrace the platform for different persons, from engineers and analysts to C-level professionals. | Fabric: This is a key feature and USP of Fabric that caters to various individuals, from engineers and analysts to C-level professionals.                                    |                                                    |
| **Customer Support**      | As Databricks is integrated within your cloud provider, the support ticket is created with the cloud provider.                                        | Support ticket is created with Microsoft.                                                                                                                                                                                              | Fabric: In many cases, the support ticket issue requires expert-level knowledge for which sometimes the cloud provider has to involve Databricks Team to assist the resolution of the ticket, which increases the duration of ticket resolution due to the additional hop. |                                                    |
| **Documentation & Community Support** | Databricks is a 10 years old company growing exponentially with an increasing community and documentation.                                    | Microsoft Data Analytics Platform has been in the industry for more than 25 years with larger community-boosted programs like MVP, MCP. Additionally, with Microsoft Learn and inbuilt Lab, the documentation has gone to another level. | Fabric: Due to a longer presence and multiple community programs and Microsoft Learn features.                                                                                |                                                    |

| **Future RoadMap**        | Databricks has been adding new features to the platform on a regular basis, and based on the funding they are receiving (available on the public forum), they are here to stay and going to grow. | Microsoft has been expanding on the Analytics platform from Azure Datawarehouse to Synapse and now to Fabric.                                                                                                                          | Databricks: Since they are focused on a single offering, they are adding features to the same service. As compared to Microsoft, who are introducing new services, definitely with additional features, but then we need to bear the cost of migration from older to newer servers. | Databricks is depth-centric but Fabric is more breadth-centric |
